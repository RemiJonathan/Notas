## Introduction

The goal of this project was to visualize the frequency analysis of a 
Cesar ciphertext. 

By using the interface is provided you can firstly load a sample of 
text (The larger the better) of the same language as the ciphertext 
that you wish to decipher. This will then allow you to produce a chart
 which is the frequency of the plane text (The larger the text the 
 closer that frequency will be to the true frequency of that language).

Next, you can load in a ciphertext preferably at least one line long 
but anything can do. You can then analyze that text and see its 
frequency. By nature even though the characters are not the same if 
I text is Cesar Cipher it will maintain the same frequency shape as 
the original language and so by using the secondary module "Breaking 
the cipher" we are able to align these two frequencies in order to 
find out the correct deciphered output.

In both blocks sample texts are provided. Simply click on one of the 
cyan boxes in order to load these texts into their respective boxes 
and then press analyze in order to see their frequencies.

## **Expected Usage Steps**
1. In the `Lengthy Plain Text` box, paste a long text in the desired language (or use one provided by pressing one of the buttons).
2. Click `Analyse`. You will the the frequency of the plain will text appear.
3. In the `Cipher Text` paste the Caesar cipher text (or use one provided by pressing one of the buttons).
4. Click `Analyse`. You will the the frequency of the cipher text will appear.
