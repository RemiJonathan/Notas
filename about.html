        <h1>Caesar cipher</h1>
        <p> In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar
            shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution
            cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the
            alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The
            method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
        </p>
        <p>The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes,
            such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all
            single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers
            essentially no communications security.

        </p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet
            rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left
            rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):</p>
        <code>
            Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br/>
            Cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
        </code><br/><br/>
        <p>When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the "plain" line and writes down the
            corresponding letter in the "cipher" line.</p>
        <code>
            Plaintext: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG <br/>
            Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
        </code><br/><br/>
        <P>Deciphering is done in reverse, with a right shift of 3.</P>
        <P>The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into
            numbers, according to the scheme, A → 0, B → 1, ..., Z → 25. Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be
            described mathematically as,</P>
        <h4><em>E<sub>n</sub>(x) = (x + n) mod 26.</em></h4>
        <p>Decryption is performed similarly,</p>
        <h4><em>E<sub>n</sub>(x) = (x - n) mod 26.</em></h4>
        <p>(There are different definitions for the modulo operation. In the above, the result is in the range 0 to 25;
            i.e., if x + n or x − n are not in the range 0 to 25, we have to subtract or add 26.)</p>
        <p>The replacement remains the same throughout the message, so the cipher is classed as a type of monoalphabetic
            substitution, as opposed to polyalphabetic substitution.</p>

        <h2>Breaking the cipher</h2>
        <p>The Caesar cipher can be easily broken even in a ciphertext-only scenario. Two situations can be
            considered:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>an attacker knows (or guesses) that some sort of simple substitution cipher has been used, but not
                specifically that it is a Caesar scheme;
            </li>
            <li>an attacker knows that a Caesar cipher is in use, but does not know the shift value.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the first case, the cipher can be broken using the same techniques as for a general simple substitution
            cipher, such as frequency analysis or pattern words. While solving, it is likely that an attacker will
            quickly notice the regularity in the solution and deduce that a Caesar cipher is the specific algorithm
            employed.</p>
        <p>In the second instance, breaking the scheme is even more straightforward. Since there are only a limited
            number of possible shifts (26 in English), they can each be tested in turn in a brute force attack. One
            way to do this is to write out a snippet of the ciphertext in a table of all possible shifts – a
            technique sometimes known as "completing the plain component". The example given is for the ciphertext
            "EXXEGOEXSRGI"; the plaintext is instantly recognisable by eye at a shift of four. Another way of viewing
            this method is that, under each letter of the ciphertext, the entire alphabet is written out in reverse
            starting at that letter. This attack can be accelerated using a set of strips prepared with the alphabet
            written down in reverse order. The strips are then aligned to form the ciphertext along one row, and the
            plaintext should appear in one of the other rows.</p>
        <p>
            Another brute force approach is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the
            frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the
            original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot the value of the shift by looking at the
            displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the
            English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically
            least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual
            frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can
            be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            For natural language plaintext, there will typically be only one plausible decryption, although for
            extremely short plaintexts, multiple candidates are possible. For example, the ciphertext MPQY could,
            plausibly, decrypt to either "aden" or "know" (assuming the plaintext is in English); similarly, "ALIIP" to
            "dolls" or "wheel"; and "AFCCP" to "jolly" or "cheer" (see also unicity distance).

            With the Caesar cipher, encrypting a text multiple times provides no additional security. This is because
            two encryptions of, say, shift A and shift B, will be equivalent to a single encryption with shift A + B. In
            mathematical terms, the set of encryption operations under each possible key forms a group under
            composition.
